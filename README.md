<br>
<h5>=> I'm a beginner in programming and do it for fun.</h5>
<br>
<h5>=> I'm a school student.</h5>
<br>
<h5>=> I like to work with HTML and CSS mainly but sometimes take Python and JavaScript.</h5> 
<br>
<h5>=> I can be a lazy slug sometimes and just binge watch like a loser.</h5>
<br>
<h5>=> Honestly, I like to code by myself and prefer as little communication, collaboration and sociality as possible. You know, social distancing...</h5>
